<p class="text-center mx-auto">
    A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other
    viennoiserie, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
    laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
    <br><br>
    Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian, Italian, and French bakeries and
    p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that
    can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants
    sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
    <br><br>
    Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
